Project: Todo List 

Assignment from The Odin Project:

Creating a simple to-do list.

Todos are dynamically created objects with several properties, like title and description.

The app uses "projects", or separate lists of todos. Users are able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.

Todos and projects can be added and removed.
